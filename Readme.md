Importing Libraries: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical computations.


Defining Genetic Algorithm Parameters: Several parameters are defined that control the behavior of the genetic algorithm:

1- population_size: The number of individuals (solutions) in each generation of the population.
2- num_generations: The number of generations (iterations) for which the genetic algorithm will run.
3- mutation_rate: The probability of mutation for each gene in an individual during reproduction.

Defining Fitness Evaluation Function: The evaluate_fitness() function is defined to evaluate the fitness of an individual. In this example, fitness is defined as the sum of yield and disease resistance. This function can be customized based on specific requirements and objectives.


Initializing Population: The initialize_population() function is defined to create an initial population of individuals. Each individual (dictionary) contains random genetic information (genes) for each variety of rice.


Mutation Function: The mutate() function is defined to introduce random changes (mutations) to the genetic information of an individual with a certain probability (mutation_rate). This helps introduce diversity into the population and prevent premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.


Crossover Function: The crossover() function is defined to generate offspring (child) individuals by combining genetic information from two parent individuals (parent1 and parent2). This mimics the biological process of reproduction and introduces new genetic combinations into the population.


Selection Function: The select() function is defined to select individuals for the next generation based on their fitness scores. In this code, individuals with higher fitness scores are more likely to be selected for the next generation, promoting the evolution of better solutions over time.


Main Genetic Algorithm Loop: The main loop of the genetic algorithm iterates over a predefined number of generations (num_generations). In each generation, the following steps are performed:

Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population.
Select individuals for the next generation based on their fitness scores.
Generate offspring individuals through crossover and mutation.
Replace the current population with the new population of offspring.

Getting the Best Individual: After all generations are processed, the best individual (solution) from the final population is identified based on its fitness score.


Output: Finally, the best individual and its fitness score are printed to the console.
